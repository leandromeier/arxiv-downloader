(To avoid manually building the package which I don't know how to do):

1. Some dependencies are needed, for sure the arxiv python package. Maybe run "sudo yay -S arxiv-downloader" to see which ones exactly
2. make sure arxiv-downloader/bin/arxiv-downloader is executable 
3. symlink arxiv-downloader/bin/arxiv-downloader to /usr/bin
